#ifndef MAP_H

/*
 * the map is composed of KeyFrame and LandMarks (mappoints). LandMarks are viewed in KeyFrames.
 * information about KeyFrames is stored in a KeyFrameDB
 * information about LandMarks is store in a MapPointDB
 * most functions calls are simply propagated to KeyFrameDB or MapPointDB
 *
 * KeyFrames are never really deleted from memory they're just removed from the KeyFrameDB - this should be fixed
 *  have an idea of making this a recursive data structure so we can have submaps of finite size related to each other by rigid transforms
 *   would enable easier reinitialization when tracking is lost (simply create new submap), breaking up enormously large maps that take forever for global bundle adjustment, etc
 *
 * The Map is recurvise (tree) and can hold submaps as children (which can themselves have submaps). Only one submap in the entire tree can be active at any time (setActive(), isActive). new keyframes and mappoints
 *  are added to the active map. a submap can be "registered" with the parent map when it's position is determined sufficiently such that it's keyframes and mappoints should be available to the parent map (registerWithParentMap()).
 *   mechanistically, once a map is registered with the parent the submap's local KeyFrameDB and MapPointDB are joined to the parent map's such that they are accessible from the parent's map calls to MapPointDB and KeyFrameDB functions.
 *
 *   key functionality:
 *   AddKeyFrame(KeyFrame* pKF) - adds KeyFrame to KeyFrameDB and sets this map as the KeyFrame's Map
 *   EraseKeyFrame(KeyFrame* pKF) - erases KeyFrame from KeyFrameDB, doesn't delete it
 *   SetBadKeyFrame(KeyFrame* pKF) - first removes all associations between pKF and viewed LandMarks then calls EraseKeyFrame(pKF)
 *   getKeyFrameDB() - returns underlying KeyFrameDB - should eliminate this so implementation isn't exposed - it isn't used much
 *   getMapPointDB()- returns underlying MapPointDB - should eliminate this so implementation isn't exposed - it isn't used much
 *   AddMapPoint(MapPoint* pMP, KeyFrame* pKF_ref, int idx) - mappoint must be associated with at least one keyframe (refrence keyframe)
 *          so here new Mappoint is associated with keyframe and added to MappointDB
 *    MapPoint* newMapPoint( const cv::Mat &Pos, KeyFrame* pKF, int idx) - construct new mappoint (and return pointer to it), then call AddMapPoint(MapPoint* pMP, KeyFrame* pKF_ref, int idx)
 *    visibleMapPoints(KeyFrame* pKFi, std::vector<MapPoint*> &visible_mpts) - all mappoints visible to pKFi - done by brute force projection all of mappoint in map into pKFi
 *          really should accelrate with a Bounding Volume Hierarchy or something similar
 *    int addAssociation(KeyFrame* pKF, int idx, MapPoint* pMP, bool replace); - associates Feature idx in pKF with LandMark pMP.
 *          this is done directly on pKF - really should add functionality so that it can go through KeyFrameDB
 *          with LandMark is done (appropriately) through MapPointDB
 *    int eraseAssociation(KeyFrame* pKF,  MapPoint* pMP) removes association between pKF and LandMark pMP.
 *          this is done directly on pKF - really should add functionality so that it can go through KeyFrameDB
 *          with LandMark is done (appropriately) through MapPointDB
